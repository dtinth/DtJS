DtJS is a JavaScript framework designed especially for animations that needs DOM manipulation, colors and more. It also supports a little AJAX.

DtJS function names are very short. It will take some time to learn.

Features:

  * Very small in size!
  * Specify the start value, end value, time, easing (modifiers) and callback functions and DtJS will do the rest.
  * Color manipulation.
  * Basic XMLHttpRequests.
  * Some DOM utilities.
